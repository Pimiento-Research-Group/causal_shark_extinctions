# Environmental shark extinction drivers
This is the repo for the current project from the Pimiento lab under the lead of G. Mathes, where we try to estimate the true (unbiased) effect of various environmental parameters on shark extinction risk using a newly compiled database of fossil shark occurrences. 

## To do  

- [ ] Update data readme
- [X] Calculate geographic range per bin
- [X] Repeat analysis with 10 myr bins
- [X] Use unambiguous taxonomic names
- [X] Add all models to productivity beta estimation
- [X] Repeat analysis with genus instead of species
- [X] Repeat analysis with Cenozoic subset at higher resolution
- [X] Repeat analysis with Superorders
- [X] Omit the last temporal stage 
- [X] Calculate log-odds for temperature per bin by using a mixed effect model
- [ ] Clean-up and streamline according to temperature analysis
