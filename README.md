# Environmental shark extinction drivers
This is the repo for the current project from the Pimiento lab under the lead of G. Mathes, where we try to estimate the true (unbiased) effect of various environmental parameters on shark extinction risk using a newly compiled database of fossil shark occurrences. 

## To do  

- [ ] Update data readme
- [ ] Repeat analysis with 10 myr bins
- [ ] Repeat analysis with genus instead of species
